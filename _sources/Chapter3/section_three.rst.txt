What is the effect of running the model without disturbance?
============================================================

A forest landscape unit existing without getting affected by disturbances is usually only possible in theory, as natural disturbance types like wildfire and insect disturbances are integral to the forest landscape.

However, in the absence of disturbances, the area under simulation would remain a relatively constant net C sink, which means having relatively constant positive values for NBP. Understanding that the area does not experience large emissions from disturbances, a significant decline in NPP is unlikely to happen.

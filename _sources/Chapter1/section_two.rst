=============================================================

`Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) <https://moja.global/flint/>`_ is a moja global software used for measuring, reporting, verifying (MRV), or forecasting greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture, and other land uses (AFOLU).

FLINT Handbook
==============

"There is nothing permanent except change. - Heraclitus ". 

Change is a phenomenon we are taught to expect or welcome, but what should we do if those changes bring about adverse and unfortunate events? An excellent example of such a change is climate change. 

Climate change can be referred to as long-term temperature and weather pattern shifts. Although these shifts may be natural, human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation have been the major cause of climate change since the 1800s. Other causes of climate change include solar variability, volcanic activity, etc.

Land use associated with agriculture, forestry, and human development results in the emission of greenhouse gases that envelop the earth. Fossil fuels are a major source of emissions, but they are not the focus of FLINT.

With climate change resulting in hotter temperatures, more severe storms, increased drought, rising sea levels, higher health risks, etc., more attention has been given to mitigating the effects of human-induced climate change, cue FLINT.

The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) is a moja global software used for measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture, and other land uses (AFOLU).

Consistent with the guidelines by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), FLINT utilises multiple data streams to forecast future greenhouse gas emissions and removals.


**What this handbook will contain.**

The FLINT handbook will discuss understanding climate science, the problems climate change poses to our environment, and steps we can take to mitigate the effects.

Expanding on FLINT, this handbook seeks to highlight FLINT modules, inputs and expected outputs from the tool. We shall discuss using carbon models like the Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) to assess the natural and anthropogenic effects of disturbances like wildfire, oil and gas explorations, etc., on our forest's landscape.

Lastly, we shall walk through what the future holds for the world we live in, what does increase in carbon dioxide mean for our forests, and, more importantly, how we expect our world to change.

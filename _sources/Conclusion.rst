Conclusion
----------

This handbook introduces us to climate science and carbon models. With
its primary focus on mitigating the adverse effects of climate change,
this handbook discusses what parts moja globalâ€™s FLINT and its modules
play in this cause.

The handbook walks us through creating a GCBM simulation and using it to
assess the effects of disturbances on our landscapes. Finally, we
discuss the future of our surrounding environments and the effects of
unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions.

Although this handbook contains extensive information on the topics
discussed in the paragraphs above, it is important to note that it will
be updated occasionally. Refer to `README.md <https://github.com/moja-global/Handbook#readme>`__  to understand how to

Changing Patterns
=================

This section discusses the effects of climate change on fire regime
patterns.

Australiaâ€™s fire regime
-----------------------

The fire regimes of an area can be understood as the time of the year,
frequency, intensity, and patchiness of the fire an area experiences.

Understanding how much climate change affects our landscapes and
surrounding environment, it is essential to recognize its effect on
wildfires and wildfire patterns. The exacerbation of wildfires caused by
climate change results from the changes to the drivers of fire regimes,
which are changes in fuel amount, fuel dryness, fire weather, and
ignition.

Australia is great for studying wildfires as it is the most fire-prone
continent. Due to long-term climate trends and variability, the
continent experienced its hottest and driest year in 2019. These
compounded effects have been proven to encourage the chances of large
forest fires occurring on the continent. Coupled with the increased
frequency of forest fires, paleoclimate evidence has shown fire danger
indicators outside the range of historical experience. This evidence
proves that not only are the risks of wildfires becoming greater, but
the areas that are likely to be affected are also growing larger.

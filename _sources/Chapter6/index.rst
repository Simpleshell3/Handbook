Chapter 6: Climate Projections
===============================
The Generic Carbon Budget Model, also known as the GCBM, is a tool developed to assess and report the cumulative effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on our forests. The GCBM is a set of science modules developed by the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) to run with FLINT.

This handbook discusses climate science and the components of carbon
models. This understanding of climate science and tools like the GCBM
help us create solutions to mitigate the adverse effects of climate
change. Now that science has gifted us with the knowledge and tools to
assess our landscapes, what do we think the earthâ€™s future looks like?
How do we expect the world to change, hotter, drier, or even hotter
wetter? Utilizing the information available to us, this chapter
speculates the climate future of our world.
